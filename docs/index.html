        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>For our final project, we wanted to create a VR experience that helps people relax by incorporating nature
          elements. In this
          project, we were able to get a weather simulation that can transition between stormy and sunny days. The
          project
          is built on
          top of <a href="https://github.com/SebLague/Clouds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>
          cloud simulation done by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Sebastian Lague</a> with Unity. Due to time constraints, our focus in this project was
          simulating visually realistic lightning. It is done by mainy lightning by mainly following <a
            href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192161.192256">this SIGGRAPH paper</a>. We generated our own algorithms
          for branching and animation using the paper as a model, and with various parameter tweaking, we were able to
          generate a stormy scene with lightning strikes.</p>

        <h2> Technical Approach </h2>

        Overall, our technical approach pulled from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192161.192256">this SIGGRAPH
          paper from 1994</a> involving the visual simulation of
        lightning. There
        were other options and papers to choose from, such as this which involves physically based lightning rendering.
        However, we realized that
        in the given time constraints we could not execute such a complicated design in real time in Unity, and we
        wanted to work with a game engine and
        deliver real time results. For this reason, we went with the approach outlined by the original SIGGRAPH paper.


        <h3 id="geometry">Geometry</h3>
        <p>
          The geometry approach of our lightning is directly modeled off of the SIGGRAPH paper, with various parameter
          difference, for more aesthetic and visually appealing results.
        </p>

        <p> A single <b>lightning stroke</b> is modeled
          as a tree structure of <b>lightning branches</b>, the root of which is called the <b>main channel</b>. A
          lightning branch, is made up of an array of individual <b>lightning segments</b>. To construct such a
          structure, we first generate the individual segments in an array. Then, we iterate through the array and
          with
          some probability,
          at index $i$, construct a child branch that branches after segment $i$. We would do this up to a maximum
          depth
          (which was 5 in our case).
        </p>

        <p>
          Lightning segments were modeled as cylinder primitives that would contain a starting position and a length
          vector that would determine its size and direction. Lightning is often stepped and winding, and as a result,
          we had a somewhat complex algorithm for determining the direction of successive segments. Let $v_0$ be the
          starting vector of the first segment in a given branch. Then, for a segment $i$, its direction vector $v_i$,
          we have that $\angle (v_{i-1} + v_0), v_i$ is a normal random variable with mean $0.279$ radians and variance
          $0.1$. This differs from the SIGGRAPH paper, which just used $v_0$. We used $v_{i -1} + v_0$ since it alloww
          lightning to meander more realistically while also having a bias towards the ground. Initially, we followed
          all
          the numbers listed on the paper. The results were not bad, but the lightning was rather linear and straight
          with little variation. Then after adding the change above, we also played around with
          <code>segment_angle</code> and <code>max_depth</code> of lightning branches to achieve more zig-zagged
          lightning. The difference is significant, and can be seen below.

        <p>
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="images/lightning2.gif" />
            <!-- <figcaption>Demo Image from SebLague</figcaption> -->
          </div>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="images/zigzag.gif" />
            <!-- <figcaption>Demo Image from SebLague</figcaption> -->
          </div>
        </div>

        <p> For child branches, their initial segment was chosen to be between 0.25 and 0.75 radians with respect to
          the
          parent segment. Finally, the initial segment was chosen to have an angle of a random variable with mean
          $0.279$ and variance $0.1$ with respect to the down vector. This can be replaced with any vector that moves
          towards the ground component.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we needed to determine how the width of each lightning stroke changes. Since the width of the
          stroke
          is also a factor in the glow of the branch, we right now only look at the maximum width. Since lightning
          sends
          most of its energy through the main channel, the width of each successive segment is the same throughout the
          stroke.
          For any child branches, the rules are different. Successive branches are $0.95$ the width of the previosu
          segment, and
          the initial branch is chosen uniformly to be between $0.85$ and $0.95$ the width of its parent segment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other randomized components of lightning were the length of each segment, which was chosen to be between
          $0.04$ and $0.075$ of the distance
          from the start and ending positions of the lightning. A GIF of the lightning geometry is available below:

        </div>
        <!-- end geometry -->


        <h3 id="animation"> Animation </h3>
        <p>
          For animation, there were multiple components we wanted to model with regards to the lightning, namely:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Visual progression from top to bottom
          </li>
          <li>
            Decaying stroke brightness
          </li>
          <li>
            Return strokes on the main channel (i.e when the main channel flashes back and forth)
          </li>
        </ul>

        In reality, no such visual progression exists, however we often percieve lightning as moving from the clouds
        to
        the ground, and so it is best animated as such.
        </p>

        <h4> Visual Progression </h4>
        <p>
          For the visual progression, we decided to index each segment on the lightning branch and use that to
          calculate
          at what time it renders. For this we defined
          a <b> propagation speed </b> variable that determines how "fast" the lightning bolt renders from top to
          bottom.
          In particular, if $p$ is the propagation speed of segment at index $i$ and $a$ is the age
          then at every frame, we check if $p \cdot a > i$, and if it is, then we render that specfic segments. For
          branch
          segments, we simply set the initial index of the first segment to be equal to its parent
          segment's index plus 1.
        </p>

        <h4> Decaying Stroke Brightness </h4>
        <p>
          For the decaying stroke brightness we used a combination of tricks. We first computed the brightness as an
          exponentially decaying function that depends on the age of the lightning. In particular, if $m$ is the
          maximum
          age, and $a$ is its current age, then the brightness is:

          $$c \exp \left( -\frac{ab}{m} \right) $$

          where $c, b$ are tweaked constants.
        </p>

        <h4> Return Strokes </h4>

        <p>
          Lightning often flashes 1-3 times in visual effects called <b> return strokes </b>. To simulate this, we
          added
          a
          decaying sinusoid to the exponential decay function for only the main channel. If the number of return
          strokes
          is $r$ and $a, m$ are
          defined as they were before, then we add the following quantity to the decaying brightness:

          $$ d f^{\frac{a}{m}} \sin \left( \frac{(2r + 1) \pi a}{m}\right) $$

          where $d$ and $f$ are constants relating to the return stroke variance and the decay of the return strokes.
          The $(2r + 1)$ term ensures that the
          sinusoid repeats $r$ times before finally dying out.
        </p>

        <h3 id="color"> Color and Material </h3>
        <p>We first considered using emissive material, which can be achieved by just checking the emission checkbox
          for
          any material.
          However, the resulting material doesn’t look glowy like we imagined. As shown on the bottom left.
          We found out that you can download a “Post Processing Package” in Unity, which function kinda like a shader.
          Then we add Post-processing Layer and Post-Processing Volume with Bloom effect to the main camera.
          After that, we achieved the desired effect, as shown on the bottom right.

        <h3 id="unity"> Unity Integration </h3>
        <p>Using cylinder game objects to model lightning segments allowed us to integrate lightning animations in
          Unity. First, we can assign a glowing material to them to make them look visually similar to lightning.
          This also allows us to have variating brightness in a lightning strike.
          On top of that, we can define the width of the cylinder to recreate the thinning effect.
          The other effect is propagation, and all we had to do is number all branches and segments.
        </p>
        <p>To create a smooth transition between stormy and sunny weather, we use Unity's <code>Update()</code> function
          that upadates per frame. The function
          will generate
          a new lightning with probability equal to global variable <code>SpawnProb</code>. The function also keeps
          track of a list of all lightning, updating the animation of each lightning and removing it from the list
          when
          a lightning reaches the end of it's life cycle. During the transition phrases from stormy to sunny, we
          decrement <code>SpawnProb</code> geometrically to slowly limit the number of lightning as the weather
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>We also did a linear interpolation of the the
          parameter of the stormy clouds to sunny clouds to achieve a smooth transition.</p>

        <h3 id="vr"> VR Integration </h3>
        <p>
          Just to make things interesting, we also added a VR Camera Rig into the scene.
          The following GIF shows one of our member moving from the perspective of the plane and the real time
          rendering
          of lightnings using the VR headset.

        <h3 id="challenges"> Problems and Challenges </h3>
        <p>
          The main problem we encountered is that none of us know unity very well going into the
          project. It took us a while to learn the structure of Unity as well as the basic syntax of
          <code>C#</code>. There are probably a lot of ways we could have used compute shaders or rendering pipelines
          in
          Unity
          that would have benefitted our project, and made the code run faster, however there wasn't a sufficient
          amount
          of time to understand
          all of the moving components of shaders in Unity for this project. It also wasn't clear that using shaders
          was
          going to make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenges we encounted is that since we are basing our project on someone else's code and building
          new features on top, the limited documentation makes it harder to understand the codebase. The only
          documentation we really had was
          a video explaining the project, and it was a bit difficult to understand some of the mechanics as well as
          how
          shaders were used to produce
          the final results.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also realized that the modeling of lightning is very subjective, and producing a realistic result
          requires
          a lot of parameter tweaking, even from the paper. The paper was often vague about processes such as
          branching
          probability, and animation, so we
          had to tweak and come up with our own interesting techniques to simulate lightning. For this project, our
          branching algorithm and the return stroke and brightness computation were
          tweaked and enhanced by our own creativity.
        </p>
        <!-- end challenges -->

        <h3 id="lessons learned"> Lessons Learned </h3>
        <p>Parameter tweaking took a lot of time. It was pretty tedious but made the biggest visual differences.</p>
        <p>We realize how hard it is to work off of someone else' code, especially when there is no documentation.</p>
